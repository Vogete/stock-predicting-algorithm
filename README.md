# Stock Predicting Algorithm

This is a collaboration between Andrew Chepreghy and Zoltán Fraknói as a final school project at KEA (Copenhagen School of Design and Technology).

The aim of the project is to create an algorithm using some form of Machine Learning that is able to do sentiment analysis on a set of texts that are believed to be highly correlated with stock prices (Newspapers, Twitter, etc) and making connections with which it can predict how certain stocks will fluctuate. As of now we define an adequate prediction that is better than random. Later in the process we wish to outperform the simple "buy and hold" strategy.
