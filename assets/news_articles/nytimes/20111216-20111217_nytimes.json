On Thursday the company said that a new line of smartphones that it hoped would turn around its flagging fortunes would not come to market until late next year, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/business/rims-quarterly-profit-falls-71.html?ref=technology\">Ian Austen reports</a>. <p> A lot is riding on these phones because they will use an operating system known as BlackBerry 10, replacing the company’s older, aging software. They could be RIM’s last hope of reversing its fortunes, which have suffered as smartphones from Apple and devices running Google’s Android software have surged. The company also said that its third-quarter net income fell 71 percent as it chopped the price of its BlackBerry PlayBook tablet and covered the costs of a big service interruption. </p><p> Gizmodo <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5868598\">says</a> that the PlayBook, which has been met with a cold reception in the marketplace, is putting the whole company at risk: “It’s RIM’s Gilligan, albatross, and giant self-destruct button all rolled into one.” The tablet could be sucking up financial and personnel resources that the company needs to bolster its more viable products, according to Gizmodo. </p><p> Writing for PaidContent, Tom Krazit <a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-why-rim-needed-to-fire-its-co-ceos-months-if-not-years-ago/\">lays the blame</a> on RIM’s co-chief executives, Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis.
