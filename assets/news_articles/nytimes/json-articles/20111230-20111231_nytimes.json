A Delaware court ruled Wednesday that the letter that led to Mr. Hurd’s resignation on Aug. 6, 2010, could be made public. The court did not release the letter yet, but the document <a href=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/hurd_letter.pdf\">was obtained by The Times</a> from someone close to the case. <p>The letter was from a lawyer, Gloria Allred, to Mr. Hurd, and described his relationship with Jodie Fisher, accusing him of sexually harassing her. The letter set in motion internal investigations at the company that resulted in Mr. Hurd’s resignation.</p> <p>Mr. Hurd fought to keep the letter private. And after Ms. Fisher settled her dispute with him, two days before his resignation, she said the letter contained many inaccuracies. Nonetheless, by offering a detailed chronology of Ms. Fisher’s view of her relationship with Mr. Hurd, the letter is getting a lot of attention.
