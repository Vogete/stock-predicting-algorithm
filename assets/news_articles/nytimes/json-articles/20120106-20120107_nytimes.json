Chen, technology reporter for The Times, writes in an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/technology/nook-from-barnes-noble-gains-more-e-book-readers.html\">accompanying article</a> that the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/apple_computer_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\" class=\"tickerized\" title=\"More information about Apple Incorporated\">Apple</a> <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/ipad/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" class=\"tickerized\" title=\"More articles about iPad.\">iPad</a> has yet to wipe out the e-readers like the Nook, though that was the popular prediction. He also reports that I.H.S. iSuppli, a research company, estimates that Barnes & Noble has 13 percent of the e-reader market after two years in the business, versus 67 percent for Amazon. </p><p> The <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2012/01/bn-separate-nook/\">Epicenter blog</a> noted: <blockquote>So what’s the problem? Even though Nook set records, and overall retail sales for the holidays were up, sales of the Nook Simple Touch e-reader were disappointing. A price cut from $140 to $100 to match the new Kindle Touch couldn’t give the six-month-old Touch enough of a boost going into the holidays. </blockquote> <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/barnes-and-nobles-most-valuable-business-isnt-what-you-think-it-is-2012-1?op=1\">Business Insider</a> was highly skeptical. Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry wrote: <blockquote>Nook’s only advantage in the market is Barnes & Noble’s retail: that the Nook is heavily promoted in B&N stores, and B&N still has heft in the book business to get publishing deals.</blockquote> He concluded, “In the long term, Nook is doomed. It has been a valiant effort, but Kindle economics are too powerful.”</p>","blog":{},"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"type":"image","subtype":"xlarge","url":"images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-articleLarge.jpg","height":400,"width":600,"rank":0,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"400"}},{"type":"image","subtype":"thumbnail","url":"images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"width":75,"rank":0,"legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images/2011/11/30/technology/bits-daily-report/bits-daily-report-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"}}],"headline":{"main":"Daily Report: Barnes & Noble Considers Spinning Off Its Nook Unit","kicker":"Bits Blog"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2012-01-06T06:22:31Z","document_type":"blogpost","byline":{"original":"By THE NEW YORK TIMES"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"54f31d9438f0d8529ba35ee4","word_count":321,"score":0},{"web_url":"https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/daily-report-barnes-noble-considers-spinning-off-its-nook-unit/","snippet":"The Nook is selling well, although Amazon's Kindle products still dominate the e-reader market.
